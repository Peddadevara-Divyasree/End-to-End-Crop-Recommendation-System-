# End to End Machine Learning-Based üåæ Crop Recommendation System with AWS Deployment

The **Crop Recommendation System** is a machine learning-based application developed to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in selecting the most suitable crops for their fields. By analyzing environmental and soil conditions, this system aims to optimize crop yields and maximize profitability. It considers factors like soil type, climate, rainfall, temperature, humidity, and pH levels to provide personalized recommendations tailored to the specific conditions of a farm or agricultural region.  

## üìã Project Overview  

This system leverages historical data and advanced predictive models to suggest crops that best match the environmental parameters provided by the user. The recommendations are designed to help farmers make informed decisions and improve agricultural efficiency.  

## üåü Key Features  
The Crop Recommendation System includes a range of features to enhance usability and performance. Users can input data such as soil parameters, climate conditions, and geographic location, which is then preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize data, and process categorical variables. Various machine learning algorithms, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM, and Gradient Boosting, are employed to develop accurate predictive models. The trained models are evaluated using appropriate metrics to ensure reliability. The system provides crop recommendations based on these models through a user-friendly interface that simplifies data entry and result interpretation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and Tools  

The application is built using Python and employs key libraries such as Scikit-learn for machine learning, Pandas for data manipulation, and NumPy for numerical computations. Flask serves as the web framework to manage HTTP requests and build the application interface, while HTML, CSS, and JavaScript enhance the user experience on the front end. Deployment on AWS ensures scalability and accessibility.

## üöÄ Getting Started  

To use the application, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. Once installed, you can run the application locally using Flask. After starting the application, access it via a web browser at http://localhost:5000. Detailed steps are provided below:

    Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/crop-recommendation-system.git.
    Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt.
    Run the application: python app.py.
    Access it locally at http://localhost:5000.
 ## üåê Deployment
 The Crop Recommendation System is deployed on AWS to provide reliable and scalable access. Users can interact with the live application via the provided deployment link.
## üîÆ Future Improvements

Future enhancements for this system include integrating real-time weather data to improve recommendation accuracy and adding market price analysis to assist in making economically viable decisions. Developing a mobile application will further enhance accessibility, while incorporating user feedback will help in continuously improving the system‚Äôs performance.
